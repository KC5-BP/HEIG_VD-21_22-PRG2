# HEIG_VD-21_22-PRG2-Exos

## Tree/Content
You'll find the template of each exercise in the ["template" folder](template)
and the corrected version in the ["corr" folder](corr).

Both of them are organised as followed :
- Chapter 1 : **Introduction**
- Chapter 2 : **Pointers**
- Chapter 3 : **Composed Types**
- Chapter 4 : **Strings**
- Chapter 5 : **Files**

_Tips :_ 

Fork the repository to your profile and do the exercise on the template
folder or duplicate it if you want to keep the template folder untouched.

_Nota Bene :_

This repo. is written 21_22, but exercises are seemingly close between years and 
will probably be re-used for the years to come (as they were re-used at 
least the previous year).
